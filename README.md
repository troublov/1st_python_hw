## 1st Python hw GitHub ~~publishing~~ pushing 
Recently I've created my GitHub account called 
[@troublov](https://github.com/troublov) which stands for 
conjunction of my usual i-net nickname and surname.

This repository contains small Python script. It takes only two floats and powers *1st* into the *2nd*.
You can use *--help* to read help file with specification.

Here is the example of how it works:
```bash
python3 mini_argparse.py -n 2 -p 4.5
```


So the sequence is as follows:
- [X] Create new repository on GitHub
- [X] Push script into
- [X] Send to the superviser
- [ ] Receive an answer
